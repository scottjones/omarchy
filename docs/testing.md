# Testing

How the non-graphical test suites are organized: what each runner owns, the
protocol test files speak, and the conventions that keep them runnable on any
machine — including headless CI sandboxes with no compositor. The graphical
acceptance suite is a separate thing that drives a live session in a disposable
VM; see [`agents/skills/acceptance-tests.md`](../agents/skills/acceptance-tests.md).

## Suite map

`./test/all` runs both suites below and keeps going when one fails, so a single
failure cannot hide the other suite behind it. It reports the failed suites at
the end and exits non-zero.

- **`./test/cli`** — one big script, one suite. It owns the CLI router: help
  and group rendering, route resolution, aliases, hidden commands, and the
  guarantee that a trailing `--help` never executes the target. It also owns
  the metadata lint — every `omarchy-*` executable under `bin/` is checked for a
  `# omarchy:summary=` header and against removed or redundant fields — plus
  the theme pipeline: template rendering (`omarchy-theme-set-templates`,
  `omarchy-theme-color`, `omarchy-theme-osc`), the theme sync commands
  (tmux, GNOME, VS Code, Pi, Claude) run against stub binaries and a fake
  `$HOME`, and the theme-state migrations.
- **`./test/shell`** — runs every `test/shell.d/*-test.sh` (except
  `base-test.sh` itself). Each file is an independent suite covering one area:
  a shell plugin, a `bin/` command, a config invariant, a migration. This is
  where new tests go.
- **Acceptance** — everything that needs a real desktop doing real things.
  Deliberately excluded from `./test/all`; it runs in a VM, not the
  development session.

A new shell test only needs the right name: drop `<area>-test.sh` into
`test/shell.d/` and `./test/shell` picks it up automatically. Shared fixtures
live under `test/shell.d/fixtures/`.

## The base-test.sh contract

Every shell test starts the same way:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -euo pipefail

source "$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)/base-test.sh"
```

`base-test.sh` refuses to be executed directly — it is a library. It discovers
the repo root from its own location and exports it as `ROOT`, so tests
reference files as `$ROOT/bin/...` and never depend on the caller's working
directory or an installed Omarchy.

Assertions are TAP-flavored and blunt:

- `pass "description"` prints `ok - description`.
- `fail "description" [detail]` prints the optional detail and
  `not ok - description` to stderr, then **exits the file**. There is no
  counting or continuing within a file: the first failed assertion ends it,
  which keeps later assertions from reporting against state the failure
  already invalidated.
- `require_command <cmd>` fails the file when a needed tool is absent.

The runner compensates for that early exit: `./test/shell` continues past a
failing file and summarizes the failures at the end. Aborting the whole run at
the first bad file once let a single packaging failure mask 114 of 134 files.
Failure granularity is therefore per file inside a run, per assertion inside a
file.

## Compositor-dependent tests

Some tests launch Quickshell or query Hyprland, but the suite must stay green
on headless machines. `require_compositor "description"` handles this: when no
compositor answers it prints `ok - no Wayland compositor; skipping ...` and
exits 0 — a skip is a passing test — and otherwise returns so the file
proceeds.

The probe is more than an environment check, because `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` only
proves the variable was inherited. Sandboxes pass the environment through
while blocking `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, so Quickshell clears a bare variable check
and then aborts inside QGuiApplication — a core dump per launch where a skip
belonged. So `compositor_reachable` checks the socket actually exists, then
asks Hyprland itself (`hyprctl -j monitors`, retried, and only when
`HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE` makes it askable), since a compositor that died
mid-session leaves its socket behind. When the compositor is reachable,
`require_compositor` also sets `ulimit -c 0`: Quickshell leaves through
`qFatal()` if its connection drops mid-run, and the test should fail without
writing a core dump as debris.

Gate only what needs gating — put `require_compositor` in files whose runtime
half needs a live session, and keep static analysis of the same area in code
that runs unconditionally before or beside it.

## Unit-testing shell JavaScript from bash

The Quickshell plugins keep their logic in plain `.js` modules
(`shell/plugins/menu/MenuModel.js`, `bar/BarModel.js`, ...) that end in a
guarded `if (typeof module !== "undefined") module.exports = {...}` block. QML
imports them directly and ignores the guard; Node loads them as CommonJS. That
dual citizenship is what makes the shell's model logic unit-testable without a
compositor.

`run_node_test` is the bridge: it prepends a JS prelude to a heredoc and pipes
the result into `node`. The prelude mirrors the bash assertion protocol
(`pass`, `fail`, `assert`, `assertEqual`, `assertDeepEqual` — same
`ok`/`not ok` lines, same exit-on-first-failure) and provides `root` (from the
exported `ROOT`), `path`, and `requireFromRoot(relativePath)`:

```bash
run_node_test <<'JS'
const menu = requireFromRoot('shell/plugins/menu/MenuModel.js')

const parsed = menu.parseMenuJsonc('{ "items": { "root": { "label": "Go" }, }, }')
assertEqual(parsed.length, 1, 'menu parses JSONC with trailing commas')
JS
```

Roughly a quarter of the shell test files use this to test parsing, merging,
and layout logic as pure functions, reserving compositor-gated tests for what
only a live session can prove.

## Conventions worth copying

- **Stub the world, run the real code.** Tests build a scratch `bin/` of stub
  executables (`sudo`, `tmux`, `gsettings`, helper commands) that log their
  arguments to a file, prepend it to `PATH`, and then run the real script
  under test. Assertions grep the call log and the files the script wrote.
- **Fake `$HOME`, real `$OMARCHY_PATH`.** Anything touching user state runs
  with `HOME` pointed at a `mktemp -d` directory (cleaned up via
  `trap ... EXIT`) and `OMARCHY_PATH="$ROOT"`, so tests exercise the checkout
  without touching the developer's machine.
- **Migrations run directly.** A migration test builds the legacy state in a
  fake `$HOME`, runs `bash -euo pipefail "$ROOT/migrations/<ts>.sh"`, and
  asserts the resulting state — including running it twice to prove
  idempotence, and once against non-legacy state to prove it leaves user
  customization alone.
- **Assert the invariant, not the snapshot.** Config tests pin the property a
  test is named for (this widget stays adjacent to that one) rather than whole
  structures, so unrelated churn does not fail them.

## CI

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/main.yml`) runs on every push and pull request. Three jobs run in parallel on `ubuntu-24.04`:

- **syntax** — shebang-aware parse of `bin/omarchy-*`, `bash -n` on tracked `*.sh`, and shellcheck (`--shell=bash -S error`, excluding `migrations/` and `test/`)
- **test** — `./test/all` (`./test/cli` and `./test/shell`), with `omacom/omarchy-pkgs` checked out for PKGBUILD coverage
- **mac** — `./tests/all` (Mac-specific suites; root/loop rehearsals skip without privileges)

The graphical acceptance suite is not part of this workflow. Compositor-dependent shell tests skip on the headless runner.

## Install machine (GitHub-hosted ARM)

`.github/workflows/install-vm.yml` runs on every pull request, pushes to `quattro`, manual dispatch, and the nightly schedule. Each job gets a disposable `ubuntu-24.04-arm` machine with read-only repository permissions, no persisted checkout credentials, and no repository secrets. Pull requests use GitHub's default merge ref, so the test includes the proposed change and its target branch. Fork contributions remain subject to GitHub's normal workflow approval policy. Superseded runs cancel only within the same PR or ref.

The job runs `./test/vm/run-selective-edge` with both package-source and idempotency checks enabled. It verifies the signed Arch Linux ARM rootfs and builds an isolated channel snapshot from the candidate source, pinned recipes, legacy overlay, and signed compositor dependency closure using the pinned publisher tooling. No release needs to exist for an arbitrary PR. The normal production manifest validator checks this actual repository; guest-only shell transport maps only the selected canonical channel URLs to its immutable files. Other URLs pass through unchanged, missing fixture files fail closed, and the pacman adapter reapplies transport after configuration restoration. Production channel URLs and preflight behavior are unchanged.

After fixture construction, the package-source and full-install phases each restore an independent clean root. Transport does not preinstall Python or the stack, preserving installer bootstrap coverage. The package phase checks explicit compositor selection and current-stack repository remediation. The complete installer checks selected versions against the frozen manifest, dependency consistency, candidate helper payloads, system setup and user finalization, then repeats installation with the same assertions. The fixture is mounted read-only during these phases.

`install.sh` rebuilds its own desktop archives; this is a source-install acceptance test, not qualification of published package bytes. Logs retain the fixture manifest and the actual installer archive hashes separately. Local harness callers must supply `OMARCHY_CHANNEL_PUBLISHER_PATH` pointing to the pinned publisher checkout and `OMARCHY_PKGS_PATH` pointing to the pinned recipes. The workflow supplies both without write credentials.

`systemd-nspawn` shares the hosted ARM64 kernel; it does not require nested KVM. This validates package installation and userspace setup, including AUR builds. It cannot prove Apple Silicon boot, the Asahi kernel, GPU behavior, or a graphical desktop session. Those checks still need Apple hardware or the separate graphical acceptance environment.

Each run uses unique work and cache directories with no cache shared across jobs. A private source copy retains Git metadata and is owned by the guest build user, so guest builds can write files even when the host runner has a different UID; the original checkout is not modified. Preparation fails if less than 20 GiB is free. Package-phase, installer, assertion, and repeat-install logs are uploaded even on failure and retained for seven days. The job has a 120-minute timeout. See [runner requirements](runner-requirements.md) for host dependencies and a local invocation.

`test/shell.d/install-vm-workflow-test.sh` guards the workflow's PR coverage, hosted-runner isolation, and required validation flags. Its YAML parser requires PyYAML (`python-yaml` on Arch, `python3-yaml` on Ubuntu); CI installs it with the other test dependencies.

The ARM channel manifest preflight tests inspect repository databases with `bsdtar`, provided by `libarchive` on Arch and `libarchive-tools` on Ubuntu. The ordinary CI test job installs this dependency even though it runs on x86_64.
